Description
==========

The current study compares the performance of PSM vs. CM (non-large scale) in terms of post-match sample retention, matching and observed covariate balance, and residual confounding. Residual confounding is measured based on the expected absolute sysematic error (EASE) of negative control outcome experiments.
